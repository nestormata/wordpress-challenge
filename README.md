### Mustache
I'm usually more inclined to Twig for a site, but since this is just a plugin and in benefit to keep things small I decided to go with Mustache since it has no additional requirements, contrary to Twig, and still meets my requirement to serve as a template engine that allow me to keep things clean in templates.
